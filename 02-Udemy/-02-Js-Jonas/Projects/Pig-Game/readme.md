# Pig Game Project

You can win the game by scoring 100 points.
Each player can roll the dice from 1 to 6, each roll gets added to the "current" score and once you press hold the score gets added to the current player's score, unless you get a dice roll of 1 then it resets the "current" score points and moves to the next player.
